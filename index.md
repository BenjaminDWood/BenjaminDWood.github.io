## Biography

Having worked in various fields relating to finance and data analysis post-graduation, I turned my focus towards a career in education, where I ultimately rose to manage the operations of language-learning centres in Vietnam, with teams of up to 30 teachers reporting to me.

In 2024, I decided to transition back to a data-based career. Since leaving teaching in March 2025, I‚Äôve completed multiple courses in data analysis and data science, and built hands-on projects in Python, SQL, and Tableau. My focus now is on developing practical, insightful solutions through data cleaning, analysis, visualisation, machine, and deep learning.

## Technical Skills
 - **Programming & Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn), SQL
 - **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
 - **Tools**: Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, basic automation), Google Sheets, Jupyter, Git, GitHub, Power BI (basic)
 - **Soft Skills**: Communication, stakeholder engagement, reporting, team leadership

## Projects

### [FIFA21 Player Data](https://github.com/BenjaminDWood/FIFA)
*Exploratory analysis & visualisation of FIFA21 dataset* 
- The [FIFA21 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yagunnersya/fifa-21-messy-raw-dataset-for-cleaning-exploring/data) is large but inconsistent, with missing values and irregular formatting, making it challenging to analyse effectively.  
- After cleaning and preprocessing the data in Python using Pandas and NumPy, I explored player attributes through various visualisations in Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- The size and scope of the dataset makes it perfect for continuing to apply new skills; my next planned step is to develop a regression model to estimate the effects of age on player rating.
- **Skills:** Data cleaning & preprocessing (Python, Pandas, NumPy), exploratory data analysis, data visualisation (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

### [Democracy Data Visualisation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benjamin.wood8808/viz/AnalysisofDemocracyScoresvsGDPCapita/RegionView)
*Synthesising and visualising democracy indices across countries*
- The [Democracy Index](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/democracy-index-eiu) scores alone give limited insight into the factors influencing democracy levels. I wanted to explore how GDP per capita and geographical region might affect the outcomes.
- Creating an analysis-ready table required synthesising the required data from multiple sources using imports from the web, cleaning the data, and using lookups for each field.
- The created dashboards visualise the desired relationships, and allow users to explore the combined dataset through various filters.
- **Skills:** Data collection & synthesis (Excel, lookups), Tableau dashboards, data cleaning

### [Workout Data Visualisation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benjamin.wood8808/viz/WorkoutProgressDashboard_17536908034250/ProgressDash)
*Interactive Tableau dashboard for displaying progress in workouts over time*
- Exercise progress can be measured in multiple ways, but not all of these metrics will rise in tandem (e.g. repetitions may drop as the weight increases).
- While many workout apps that track data may include one or two metrics to show progress, a more comprehensive view, compiled in a single visualisation, is necessary to convey all areas of progress and maintain user motivation.
- The resulting dashboard, consulted on by gym-goers and trainers, uses real-world data exported from mobile applications to show these four metrics both graphically and numerically, in a way that is user-friendly and easy to interpret.
- **Skills:** Tableau parameters, calculated fields, UI design, data transformation
