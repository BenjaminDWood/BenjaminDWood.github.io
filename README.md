## Biograpy
Having worked in financial sales and data analysis post-university graduation, I took a short break to try my hand at teaching abroad. This ultimately turned into a longer and more succesful career than I had ever envisioned, spanning four countries across two continents, managing teams of teachers and the operations of large language centres, culminating in working for one of the most prestigious language academies in Vietnam.

Having worked in various fields relating to finance and data analysis post-graduation, I turned my focus towards a career in education, where I ultimately rose to manage the operations of language-learning centres in Vietnam, with teams of up to 30 teachers reporting to me.

In 2024, I decided to begin returning to my earlier interest in working with data. Since leaving teaching in March 2025, I‚Äôve completed multiple courses in data analysis and data science, and built hands-on projects in Python, SQL, and Tableau. My focus now is on developing practical, insightful solutions through data cleaning, analysis, visualisation, and introductory machine learning.

## Techincal Skills

 - **Tools**: Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, basic automation), Google Sheets, Jupyter, Git, GitHub, Power BI (basic)
 - **Soft Skills**: Communication, stakeholder engagement, reporting, team leadership

## Projects

### [FIFA22 Player Data](https://github.com/BenjaminDWood/FIFA)
*Exploratory analysis & visualisation of FIFA22 dataset* 
- **Skills:** Data cleaning, EDA, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Planned work:** Regression modelling of player attributes

- The FIFA22 dataset is large but inconsistent, with missing values and irregular formatting, making it challenging to analyse effectively.  
- After cleaning and preprocessing the data in Python using Pandas and NumPy, I explored player attributes through various visualisations in Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- The size and scope of the dataset makes it perfect for continuing to applying new skills; my next planned step is to develop a regression model to estimate the effects of age on player rating.
- **Skills:** Data cleaning & preprocessing (Python, Pandas, NumPy), exploratory data analysis, data visualisation (Matplotlib, Seaborn)



### [Democracy Data Visualisation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benjamin.wood8808/viz/AnalysisofDemocracyScoresvsGDPCapita/RegionView)
*Synthesising and visualising democracy indices across countries*
- The [Democracy Index](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/democracy-index-eiu) scores alone give limited insight into the factors influencing democracy levels. I wanted to explore how GDP per capita and geographical region might affect the outcomes.
- Creating an analysis-ready table required synthesising the required data from multiple sources using imports from the web, cleaning the data, and using lookups for each field.
- The created dashboards visualise the desired relationships, and allow users to explore the combined dataset through various filters.
- **Skills:** Data collection & synthesis (Excel, lookups), Tableau dashboards, data cleaning


### [Workout Data Visualisation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benjamin.wood8808/viz/WorkoutProgressDashboard_17536908034250/ProgressDash)
*Interactive Tableau dashboard for displaying progress in workouts over time*
- Exercise progress can be measured in multiple ways, but not all of these metrics will rise in tandem (e.g. repetitions may drop as the weight increases).
- While many workout apps that track data may include one or two metrics to show progress, a more comprehensive view, compiled in a single visualisation, is necessary to convey all areas of progress and maintain user motivation.
- The resulting dashboard, consulted on by gym-goers and trainers, uses real-world data exported from mobile applications to show these four metrics both graphically and numerically, in a way that is user-friendly and easy to interpret.
- **Skills:** Tableau parameters, calculated fields, UI design, data transformation
